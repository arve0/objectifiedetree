## Overview

Wouldn't it be nice to use dot notation for ElementTrees? This package allows for:

```python
tree = ET.fromstring('<root><a><b c="asdf" /></a></root>')
a = tree.a
b = a.b
b.attrib['c'] == "asdf" # True
```

`tree.a` will be a [`Element`-object](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element) with the extra `__getattr__` method. This means that you can use the element as you would do normally, but names in your XML that crases with python's methods or attributes must be accessed through `tree.find(xpath)`.

This package uses the python implementation of etree, which makes it slower than the C-implementation found in CPython. An alternative would be to mmonkey-patch the built-in with [forbiddenfruit](https://github.com/clarete/forbiddenfruit), but I haven't looked into this.

`objectifiedetree` has copied the etree python implementation from [CPython 3.4 Lib/xml/etree](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Lib/xml/etree) and will probably only work with Python 3.4.

## Installation

Install using `pip`...

```bash
pip install objectifiedetree
```

## Example

```python
from objectifiedetree import *

tree = ET.parse('/path/to/file.xml')
# dot notation :-)
el = tree.xpath.to.your.element

# use normal etree attributes
print(el.attrib)

# access name crashes
attrib_el = el.find('./attrib')
```
