Overview
--------

Wouldn't it be nice to use dot notation for ElementTrees? This package
allows for:

.. code:: python

    tree = ET.fromstring('<root><a><b c="asdf" /></a></root>')
    a = tree.a
    b = a.b
    b.attrib['c'] == "asdf" # True

``tree.a`` will be a
```Element`` <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element>`__
with the extra
```__getattr__`` <https://github.com/arve0/objectifiedetree/blob/master/objectifiedetree/__init__.py#L11-12>`__
method. This means that you can use the element as you would do
normally, but names in your XML that crases with python's methods or
attributes must be accessed through ``tree.find(xpath)``.

This package uses the python implementation of etree, which makes it
slower than the C-implementation found in CPython. An alternative would
be to mmonkey-patch the built-in with
`forbiddenfruit <https://github.com/clarete/forbiddenfruit>`__, but I
haven't looked into this.

``objectifiedetree`` has copied the python implementation of etree from
`CPython 3.4
Lib/xml/etree <https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Lib/xml/etree>`__
and will probably only work with Python 3.4.

Installation
------------

Install using ``pip``...

.. code:: bash

    pip install objectifiedetree

Example
-------

.. code:: python

    from objectifiedetree import *

    tree = ET.parse('/path/to/file.xml')
    # dot notation :-)
    el = tree.xpath.to.your.element

    # use normal etree attributes
    print(el.attrib)

    # access name crashes
    attrib_el = el.find('./attrib')
